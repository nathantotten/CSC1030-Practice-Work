        <p>
          Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet
          in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars
          carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as
          the "Red Planet".[16][17] The latter refers to the effect of the iron
          oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance
          distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked
          eye.[18] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with
          surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the
          valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth. The days and seasons are
          comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as
          the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are
          similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and
          highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of
          Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The
          smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the
          planet and may be a giant impact feature.[19][20] Mars has two moons,
          Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may
          be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.[21][22]
