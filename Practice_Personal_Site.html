      <h1 id="head01">About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a highly motivated, outgoing and friendly first-year student at Queen’s University Belfast studying Computer Science. Despite the pandemic I am greatly enjoying student life and my course - I have had a passion for IT & Computing from an early age but find that I frequently have spare time throughout the week, evenings and weekends which I would like to occupy with part-time work if possible. Not only would this supplement my modestly low income, but I greatly enjoy working with people and find the experiences gained worthwhile and rewarding – I would prefer to work than sit and do nothing essentially.</p>
      <p>I have 4 months previous work experience (prior to the pandemic) working in a well-known high street retail environment over the demanding Christmas and New Year period which gave me invaluable experience in the following areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Working different shift patterns including very early morning and late at night</li>
        <li>Working with members of the public of all ages</li>
        <li>Providing customers with assistance when necessary – critically being approachable and friendly no matter what I was currently doing</li>
        <li>Dealing with any general queries relating to the store or helping customers to locate items or other members of staff who might be better suited to assist them</li>
        <li>Managing my priorities to ensure I performed my contracted duties as well as providing the assistance above – ensuring that I was able to complete the work allocated to me as well as assisting customers on an ad-hoc basis</li>
        <li>Working with my team lead, his line manager & my colleagues to help them get the allocated jobs completed on time and to a high standard – learning as I went to do the job better</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I pride myself in being able to adapt to change and use my initiative to find new, creative and more efficient ways to do things – I would typically throw myself into new tasks and my enthusiasm has been commented on as being a positive asset.</p>
      <p>I work well in a team and get along very well with others, I’m easy going & relaxed and work hard to get jobs completed on time and to a very high standard. I enjoy my work and working with others, particularly the feeling we get when we collectively work well together and do a great job, with happy customers to show for it – I take great pride in everything I do.</p>
